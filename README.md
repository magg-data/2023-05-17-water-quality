# Description

The project studies the Water Quality Index in the King County, WA. 
The two questions were raised and the analysis presents the answers to those
questions:

1.  How does WQI change over the years? Select a few stations with long recording logs and answer the question, whether the water quality was better in the past, or is better now, or is worse?

2. How does WQI change depending on the geographical location? Select a few stations at different geographical locations and compare WQI. Is there any pattern such as more densely populated areas have WQI worse than sparsely populated areas? Does any of the areas such as north/south/east/west have cleaner water over the others?
